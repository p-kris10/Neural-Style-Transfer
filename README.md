# Neural-Style-Transfer
This repository contains code for Neural Style Transfer using Optimzation Method as described in the paper ["Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

This notebook is influenced by the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B22nIUhXo4E&ab_channel=TheAIEpiphany) by Godrick Aleksa's on his Youtube Channel 
and also his [implementation](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-neural-style-transfer) of NST.
