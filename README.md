# Neural-Style-Transfer
This repository contains code for Neural Style Transfer using Optimzation Method
(https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

This notebook is influenced by the video series by Godrick Aleksa's Yotube Cahnnel on Neural Style Transfer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B22nIUhXo4E&ab_channel=TheAIEpiphany)
and also his implementation of the same (https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-neural-style-transfer)
